# What Are the Top Consumer Trends in 2024?

New year, new trends. But one fact remains true--consumer behaviour can be
unpredictable.

That's why we create our annual Top Global Consumer Trends report. Predicting
customer needs and delivering solutions to their pain points are not easy
tasks. This report is your starting point, so you can get to the bottom of
consumer behaviour and lifestyle shifts. You'll use these insights for
marketing campaigns, brand activations, retail strategies and innovation
plans.

Keep reading for a look at each of the top consumer trends in 2024. Get the
report or watch our webinar for case studies and tactics that'll help you
respond to these demands.

## Ask AI

Two words: generative AI. You've probably even asked ChatGPT or Bard a
question or two in recent months.

This trend is all about ongoing experimentation and shifting expectations of
generative AI solutions. As consumers keep testing the capabilities of this
technology, they expect brands to do the same to create optimised and
personalised customer experiences.

## Delightful Distractions

Economic instability, political turmoil and everyday stressors make our lives
feel overwhelming at times. We want to find daily doses of happiness that give
us brief relief from reality.

Joy and optimism are at the core of this trend. Delightful Distractions evoke
positivity--whether that's a product designed with vibrant colours, playful
brand content or an immersive experience, among other approaches.

## Nearly three in 10 consumers would be comfortable with brands tracking
their emotions and personalising experiences to their moods

Find moments where you can uplift your customers because those touchpoints
leave a lasting impression.

## Greenwashed Out

Green fatigue is hitting new heights, but environmental concerns still weigh
heavy on our minds.

Over the years, consumers adopted sustainable habits to try and have a
positive impact on the planet. Yet, climate catastrophes continue to cause
devastation around the world.

People realise that their individual actions help…to an extent. If consumers
aren't aware of how their behaviour makes a difference, they could feel
discouraged and might not put in as much effort. Real change needs to be a
collective priority with companies and governments in the driver's seat.

## Progressively Polarised

Social or political issues can be sensitive--sometimes, contentious--topics
that cause a divide, creating Progressively Polarised behaviour.

How this trend translates into purchase decisions is nuanced. Some shoppers
buy products that reflect their values, like sustainability or political
affiliation, whilst others focus on benefits or price instead. But consumers
often exhibit both tendencies. For example, someone could buy toothpaste based
on functionality--to prevent cavities or protect enamel--whilst purchasing
eco-friendly laundry detergent tablets to limit plastic consumption.

Controversial campaigns that push a social or partisan agenda can also become
purchase detractors, even if those values weren't purchase motivators.
Complex, right? Brands have to tread a fine line here, especially with
upcoming 2024 elections around the world. Inaction isn't the answer. You need
to remain authentic and align with the values of your target audience.

## Value Hackers

Remember Budgeteers and Here and Now from last year? Well, this trend is an
evolution of those financial mindsets.

Rather than cutting overall spending or occasionally splurging on small
treats, consumers are being clever to get what they want. That could be
finding dupes, so trading down on cost but not quality, or shopping at stores
with rewards perks to rack up points for future purchases. These kinds of
lifestyle tricks help them make the most of their money.

## Wellness Pragmatists

Easy and effective--that's what underpins self-care routines this year. Forget
the 10-step beauty regimens or elaborate meal prepping. Wellness products that
are convenient to use **_and_** deliver noticeable results win out here.

Consumers are setting realistic goals and are open to trying new treatments or
brands--if they'll achieve their desired outcome. That means proven efficacy
will influence purchase choices.

## Keep up with the 2024 trends

Those are the top lifestyle trends of the year! Here are a few resources you
should check out (if you haven't already) to get deeper insights and
activation tactics:
