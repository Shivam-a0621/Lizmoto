**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

**EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA**

""EBITDA"" is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or
benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as
EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset
impairments, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities,
acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout
shares liability, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts
impacting the statement of operations during the year. Adjusted EBITDA is
intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required
by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, when
combined with net loss, and EBITDA, is beneficial to an investor's complete
understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in
evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial
measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-
GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when
evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to
those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation
of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future
results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation
of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.

Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated
in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA as supplemental performance measures.

**Forward-Looking Statements**

The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements""
within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
may be identified by the use of words such as ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""project,""
""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,""
""target"" or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events
or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-
looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding
access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance
metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and
the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet
and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to
capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer
orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These
statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this
press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo's management and are
not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are
provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and
must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a
prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and
circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from
assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of
Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market,
financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a
going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of
capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its
business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail
its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately
control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to
successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or
continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation
of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of
expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of
Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and
manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business,
and those factors discussed under the captions ""Risk Factors"" and
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
""SEC"") on March 30, 2023, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by
visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the
SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the
results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional
risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are
immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained
in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements
reflect Canoo's expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as
of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events
and developments will cause Canoo's assessments to change. However, while
Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in
the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These
forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo's
assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.
Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking
statements.
